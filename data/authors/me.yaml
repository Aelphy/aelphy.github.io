bio: |
  I am a Software Engineer at Google working on efficient on-device computing.

  I earned my PhD at ETH Zürich in the Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Lab, supervised by Prof. Dr. Konrad Schindler.
  Before moving to Switzerland I completed my masters in Moscow where I graduated with honors from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) and from Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech).
  
  I started my expansion towards west with a move to Kazan (where I spent 1 year at Innopolis) from Ekaterinburg (where I grew up and made my first bachelor degree in electrical engineering and graduated with honors from Ural Federal University).
