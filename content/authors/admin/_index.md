I am a PhD student at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch) in the [Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Lab](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Konrad Schindler](https://igp.ethz.ch/personen/person-detail.html?persid=143986).

Before moving to Switzerland I completed my masters in Moscow where I graduated with honors from [Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Institute_of_Physics_and_Technology) and from [Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech)](http://www.skoltech.ru/en)

I started my expansion towards west with move to Kazan (where I spent 1 year at [Innopolis](https://university.innopolis.ru/en/)) from Ekaterinburg (where I grew up and made my first bachelor degree in electrical engineering and graduated with honors from [Ural Federal University](https://urfu.ru/en/)).
